Amit is Alexa Evangelist at Amazon. His role involves helping developers build incredible voice experiences using Alexa - the voice enabled personality that powers groundbreaking Amazon devices like the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, and Amazon Tap. 

Passionate about beautiful design, and elegant code. An ice cream craver, cricket fanatic, and a chai latte addict. By day you can find him at his desk cooking up beautiful Ruby, Python, or JavaScript. By night, he loves catching up on the re-runs of Seinfeld.
