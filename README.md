# Me

Hello! I am Amit, a Senior Developer Advocate at [Retool](https://retool.com). Prior to joining Retool, I spent five years at Amazon, helping developers build voice skills for Alexa. By day you can find me cooking up Retool apps to solve my everyday problems. By night, when I am not doing dad duties or cooking up code, I like catching up on the reruns of Seinfeld. Self-proclaimed Lego, and Instant Pot recipe nerd. 

You can reach me on Twitter at [@amit](https://twitter.com/amit).
