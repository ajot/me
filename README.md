# Me

Amit is a Developer Educator who's spent over a decade simplifying things for developers. By day you can find him breaking down complex ideas into simple, easy-to-follow quick start guides. By night, he likes building things, and occasionally perform at stand-up comedy clubs. Self-proclaimed Seinfeld, and LEGO nerd. He lives in NYC with his wife and a two-year-old who's teaching him more about time management than any book could. 

You can find him on Twitter at [@amit](https://twitter.com/amit), and catch what he's building at [curiousmints.com](https://curiousmints.com).
